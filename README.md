Flip!
=========

An easy to use jQuery plugin that allows you to flip elements in four directions.

Installation
--------------

Add the minified.js version of Flip! to your project and insert the following script tag (edit to the correct path) into the head section of your HTML document.

```html
<script src="[path to the file]/jquery.flip.min.js"></script>
```


Flip! requires the latest versions of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/download/) and [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/download/) ; link the jQuery and jQuery UI script tags before Flip!.


Example
--------------
Here's a basic example to show you how to Flip!
```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
		<script src="jquery-ui-1.11.0.custom/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
		<script src="jquery.flip.min.js"></script>

	</head>
	<body>
		<button class = "flip">Flip</button>
		<div style= "border: 2px solid red; width: 20%; height: 40%" class = "box">
			"Let's Flip this!"
		</div>
		<button class = "flipBack">Flip Back</button>
	</body>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		$(".flip").on("click", flipDiv)
		$(".flipBack").on("click", flipBack)

		function flipDiv(){
			$(".box").flip({
				direction:"tb",
				content: "We've been flipped!",
				color: "blue",
				speed: 100
			})
		}

		function flipBack(){
			$(".box").revertFlip()
		}
	</script>
</html>
```

Options
--------------

There are many ways to customize the flip effect. Within the "flip" function, you can add various options to change the flip to your liking. Below are the listed options to add to the flip function. 


####content

Defines the new content of the flipped box. It works with: html, text or a jQuery object ex:$("selector"). In the example above, the div reads "Let's flip this!" however, after the click, the div reads "We've been flipped!"

####direction
The direction where to flip. Possible values: 'tb', 'bt', 'lr', 'rl'. The default direction is tb. 

####color
After the flip, the background will change to this color. In the example above the div is white however changes to blue after the flip.

####speed
Speed of the two parts of the animation. Accepts a range of numbers; the smaller the number, the faster the flip. The default speed is 500.

####onBefore
Synchronous function excuted before the animation starts.

####onAnimation
Synchronous function excuted at half animation.

####onEnd
Synchronous function excuted after animation's end.

revertFlip()
--------------
Included is a revertFlip function that allows you to revert a flip. In the example above, clicking the flipBack button will change the div back to its original content.

######note as of June 30th, 2014 you are unable to revert back to an original state after multiple successive flips.
